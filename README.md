This repository contains Java training material developed as part of the **BridgeLabz SIPP Program**. The repository is organized into four branches, each focusing on a core area of Java development:

---

## ðŸ“Œ Branch Overview

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Core-Java

This branch contains the foundational Java topics essential for any beginner. It introduces the basics of Java programming and builds a strong base for advanced topics.

**Topics Covered:**
- Java Syntax and Structure
- Data Types and Variables
- Operators and Expressions
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and Strings
- Exception Handling
- Input/Output (Scanner, BufferedReader)
- Introduction to Methods

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. OOPs

The `OOPs` branch dives into **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts, which are the backbone of Java programming.

**Topics Covered:**
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Overloading
- Inheritance and Super Keyword
- Polymorphism (Overriding and Overloading)
- Abstraction (Abstract Classes and Interfaces)
- Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
- Static vs Instance
- `this` and `super` keywords
- Object Class Methods (`toString()`, `equals()` etc.)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. DSA

The `DSA` branch focuses on **Data Structures and Algorithms** using Java. It emphasizes writing efficient code and solving common problems in interviews.

**Topics Covered:**
- Arrays and ArrayList
- Strings and StringBuilder
- Stack and Queue (using Array & LinkedList)
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)
- Recursion
- Hashing (HashMap, HashSet)
- Time and Space Complexity (Big O Analysis)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Generics&Packages

The `Generics&Packages` branch covers advanced concepts that improve **code reusability, type safety, and modularity** in Java applications.

**Topics Covered:**
- Generic Classes and Methods
- Bounded Type Parameters
- Wildcards (`? extends T`, `? super T`)
- Generic Constructors
- Type Erasure and its Implications
- Java Packages and Access Modifiers
- Creating and Using Custom Packages
- Composition over Inheritance
- Real-world examples of Java Generics
